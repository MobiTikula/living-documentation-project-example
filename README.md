This repository serves as a demonstration for the AbsaOSS/living-doc-generator GitHub plugin v0.1.0.

The GitHub Action repository can be found under following [link](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/living-doc-generator).
It is a result of my master's final project. I was a main contributor in this project until the version v0.4.0.
